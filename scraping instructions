download Docker from docker.com
	- choose download desktop and take a tutorial
create a free account and log in
You should see the icon on your top bar
build the image that you will be using to create containers with:

	1) go into the directory that you want your files downloaded to (you need to know where they are located using the finder if you're not sure)
		- open up a terminal type: cd/path/to/folder/you/want
		- type ls enter: you should see the files you are interested in as well as Dockerfile
		- the downloaded files will be placed in the data folder. It is VERY important that you don't change the file structure as that will cause the script to break.

	2) Dockerfile must be in one directory above the run_scrape.py file

	3) requirements file needs to be in the same location as Dockerfile

	4) type: docker build -t scraper .
		scraper = name of the image that you will make containers from. Name this whatever you like.
		. = the current directory. Docker will look for the Dockerfile in the directory you are in so it is important you start in the right place.

	5) Make a container using this image:
		type in the command line: docker run -it -w /usr/workspace -v /path/on/your/local/machine:/usr/workspace scraper bash
			- This opens up a terminal IN the container that it has created. From here you can run the script just as you would from your local machine. 
			- type in the command line prompt (ends with a #) python run_scrape.py "username" "password"
