My name is Andrew Yin and I’m an associate at EY-Parthenon, a market research and consulting firm. My team is looking to share with you a brief ~10 minute survey to learn about your perspectives on bootcamps, as it looks like you recently graduated from a software bootcamp (e.g. coding, UI/UX, data analytics, cyber security, etc.). We are happy to compensate you with a $30 Tango gift card (can be redeemed at Amazon, Target, and many other retailers, www.tangocard.com). Due to Linkedin policy, we are unable to share the survey through Linkedin, but would be happy to share it over email. If you are interested, please respond with your email address and we will send the survey shortly thereafter.', '', 'For context, my team is currently conducting research on software bootcamps that offer programs in coding / web development, UI/UX design, cybersecurity and data analytics. We’re hoping to gather student and graduate perspectives on their perceptions of and experiences at these bootcamps. Your responses will be kept strictly confidential and only used in aggregate as part of a generalized study. ', '', 'If you are not interested in participating, please kindly decline this message.

Overall, I'm glad I went as there is no way I would have learned that much on my own in such a short period of time. To sum up the experience, I would say that bootcamp introduced me to many ML concepts and algorithms but I don't feel that I have mastered ML and data science. But have the tools to master them with practice.
